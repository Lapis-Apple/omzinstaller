# OmzInstaller
A simply oh-my-zsh (and its common-used plugin) installer.
Multiple mirrors selection supported(Mainly for users in China Mainland).

# How to use?
Just simply download and run "omzinstaller.sh" as root by your way.

For example directly run this command: sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.fastgit.org/Lapis-Apple/omzinstaller/master/omzinstaller.sh)"

# Who's it made for?
Well, me.
This script is for one-key configure zsh of my computers & servers. I'm too lazy for install plugins manually :p

issues & PRs welcome!
